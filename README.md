# MatchingMarkets
A python toolbox for simulation of matching markets in economics.

The toolbox uses generic abstractions and python lambdas to produce simulations of general matching markets. Examples of matchings markets are organ exchanges, school/student assignment or matching goods and individuals in a barter economy. These markets can last one period, or can evolve over many time periods. Here is an example of a graph produced with the package of a market evolving over many periods:

In this graph, nodes are people and node color is their "type" (think patient or donor blood type in organ transplants). The number on a node is periods of life left before death if not matched. An edge means they are compatible (it can be weighed if there's risk of failure). Edges get highlighted red before matches. In this simulation, only people of the same type can be compatible, and we naively match two compatible individuals at random. Our timing decision rule here is to naively try to match everyone each period.

The figure can be produced with this code:

    import matchingmarkets as mm
    import numpy.random as rng

    newsim = mm.simulation(time_per_run=100, max_agents=5000,
                           arrival_rate=15, average_success_prob=lambda: 0.3,
                           typeGenerator=rng.randint,
                           compatFct=mm.stochastic_neighborSameType,
                           crit_input=3, numTypes=5)
    
    # Make sure matplotlib is __not__ inline for this
    newsim.graph(plot_time=0.8)
                 
                 
# Dependencies

MatchingMarkets.py aims to be "batteries included". If you use the Anaconda distribution with python 3, you should have no problems using the package.

Formally, it requires Python 3.6+, Numpy/scipy, NetworkX, matplotlib with qt5agg backend (for interactive graph plotting) This backend can be changed manually in "Markets.py" A [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) installation is included by default in `matchingmarkets/algorithms/pulp` for kidney solvers. This uses the COIN-OR cbc solver by default and can be changed to Gurobi, CPLEX or other compatible solvers manually

# Included algorithms

- Random pairwise match (default)

- [Top Trading cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_trading_cycle)

- [Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem)

- [Serial dictatorship](https://jeremykun.com/2015/10/26/serial-dictatorships-and-house-allocation/) (serial ordering is user definable with lambda input)

- [Max weight matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom_algorithm) (Based on blossom algorithm)

- [Max cardinality matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)) 

- Modern kidney solvers are not functional yet.


# Market Generating

It can be useful to try out a few settings on generators and visualize the output to see if the simuation is what you want.  The current suite of generators is in [this file](https://github.com/QuantEcon/MatchingMarkets.py/blob/master/matchingmarkets/generators/basic.py). Currently we have:

- Random or deterministic assignment of one or multiple abstract types

- Blood types (for organ transplants)

- It's easy to write a lambda and pass it in the `typeGenerator` attribute in a `mm.simulation` object. The lambda should respect the format of generator functions. 

More important is the function defining **match compatibility** based on types of agents. This is in the same file as above. Using abstract types and cutoff values for the RNG, you can simulate many classic matching problems easily. It is also easy to write a lambda which simulates the compatibility you desire as long as it respects the form **f(sourceAgent, receivingAgent, cutoff=1) -> float in [0,1]** where the result is the match success probability, and cutoff is an optional parameter usually used in an RNG.

# Use

Please refer to the [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/QuantEcon/MatchingMarkets.py/blob/master/Papers%2C%20tutorials%2C%20etc/matchingmarkets%20package%20tutorial.ipynb) for more in depth instructions.

Download the package, change directory to the one containing it in your python console, and `import matchingmarkets as mm`.

Intended use is through the `simulation` object, as follows:

    newsim = mm.simulation(
                          # Simulation parameters here
                          )
    newsim.run()
    
    #prints output of a simulation
    newsim.stats()
    
    out[5]:
    Simulation Results
    1  periods
    50  runs
    Stat      value  (std dev)
    ==================================
    Welfare:   50.04 ( 6.7675 )
    matches:   50.04  ( 6.7675 )
    perished:  0.0  ( 0.0000 )
    loss%:     0.0000  ( 0.0000 )
    
One way to get as much information about your simulation as possible is to run it with the `verbose` flag on, and plot a few periods:

    newsim.verbose = True
    newsim.graph(period=10)
    # This will print all relevant information to console, and graph the output
   
The simulation class has many attributes to simulate static (single period) or dynamic (multi-period) matching markets. 
When creating the **simulation** class, you can pass the following parameters:

          runs: int
            number of trials when runs

          time_per_run: int
              number of time periods in a run

           logAllData: bool
              log every single period on every iteration
              Takes much longer, but outputs pretty plots in the stats() function
              if false, only logs final results on each run

            arrival_rate: int
                average number of new agents per period

            metaParams: dict{string: value}
